# 5011CEM_Big-Data

The files contain code written in MATLAB in which atmospheric science and climate model data has been analysed and processed. 

Sequential and Parallel Processing has been compared in order to determine which method processes the given data the fastest. 

Using Parallel Processing, data has been processed at a much faster rate. Previously, the analysis time is approximately 2.5 hours to analyse the climate model output data for a 1-hour time period. There are 25 hours of data per day, 0 â€“ 24. The data for a single day of model output is approximately 250MB. 

Extrapolation of findings have been done to conclude the number of processors required to process the amount of data within at least under 2 hours. 7 processors are required.
